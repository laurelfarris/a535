Write reduction scripts for the APO ARCTIC and DIS observations. These can be
done either using ``primitive" routines or by using packaged ones, but in
either case, they must be compiled into a script that can be run to produce
reduced images. A reduced image is one that is ready for science analysis. For
ARCTIC, this should include overscan subtraction, bias subtraction (if
warranted), and flat fielding. For DIS, it should include all of those plus
wavelength calibration; for extra credit, include flux calibration.
