\begin{document}

\paragraph{(2/26, 30 minutes) Imagine you are looking from the Apache
Point Observatory at a star at a declination of 10 degrees when it
crosses the meridian. You are using a B filter for which the
extinction coefficient is -0.4. By how much do you need to correct the
observed brightness to determine the expected brightness outside the
Earth's atmosphere? Give the correction factor for both magnitudes and
flux. How much fainter would the star appear if you observed it 4
hours off of the meridian, compared to when you observe it on the
meridian?}
