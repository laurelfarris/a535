(1/29, 30 mins) Astronomers use several different units to measure
brightnesses: fluxes per unit wavelength (F_lambda),
fluxes per unit frequency (F_nu), and magnitudes, both
integrated and per unit wavelength and frequency ( m = - 2.5 log F).
Since magnitudes are logarithimic units, differences in magnitude
correspond to ratios in fluxes.

    A Jansky is a unit used to measure flux density, most often in the
    radio; one Jansky is 10-26Wm-2Hz-1 (note that this is an
    F$\scriptstyle \nu$ quantity). How bright is Vega at 5500 Å in
    Janskys, using the fact that the flux density of Vega at 5500 Å
    is 3.6 x 10-9ergs/cm2/sec/Å (note that this is an F$\scriptstyle
    \lambda$ quantity)?

    If a star has a flux density of 3.6 x 10-9ergs/cm2/sec/Å at
    8500 Å, how bright is it in Janskys?

    If a star has a flux density of 7.2 x
    10-14ergs/cm2/sec/Å at 5500 Å, how much fainter is it
    than Vega in magnitudes?
