\section*{Homework 2}
\subsection*{Look at the APO website at
\textcolor{blue}{\url{http://www.apo.nmsu.edu}}}

\subsubsection*{Look at the observing schedule and some observing night logs.
    What are the NMSU programs this quarter?}

\subsubsection*{Check out the 10 micron all-sky camera images at night. What are
    the images and graphs showing, and what do they tell you?}

    I clicked the link to the IR All-Sky Camera Image (which I assume is the
    same thing since 10 $\mu$ is in the IR). The two plots show the sky
    standard deviation and the sky level, both as functions of UT Time.
    They both describe the `sky history'.


\subsubsection*{Look through the instruments pages, and at anything else that might
    interest you. If anything stimulates a question, write it down.}

\subsubsection*{Submit housing request for 3/25--3/27 (3 nights).}
