\section*{Homework 2}
\subsection*{Look at the APO website at
\textcolor{blue}{\url{http://www.apo.nmsu.edu}}}

\subsubsection*{Look at the observing schedule and some observing night logs.
    What are the NMSU programs this quarter?}

    Under 1Q2016 (the first quarter for this year), there are eight different
    observing runs listed, each of which include the dates, start/end times,
    the instrument to be used, and the moon brightness (0 for new moon,
    100 for full moon?).
    The instruments to be used, as written on the site, are
    `V', `DRE', `RS-custom', `D-B1200+R1200', `N', `E', and `R-MSSSO?'.
    There is no instrument listed under the third observing run.


\subsubsection*{Check out the 10 micron all-sky camera images at night. What are
    the images and graphs showing, and what do they tell you?}

    I clicked the link to the IR All-Sky Camera Image (which I assume is the
    same thing since 10 $\mu$ is in the IR). The two plots show the sky
    standard deviation and the sky level, both as functions of UT Time.
    They both describe the `sky history'.


\subsubsection*{Look through the instruments pages, and at anything else that might
    interest you. If anything stimulates a question, write it down.}

\subsubsection*{Submit housing request for 3/25--3/27 (3 nights).}

    Apparently this is ``Forbidden''... maybe becaue I'm doing it from my
    laptop?
