\BOOKMARK [3][-]{subsubsection.0.0.4}{ If a star with a spectral energy distribution like Vega has a magnitude of 21 at 4500 \305 in the VEGAMAG system \(i.e. spectrum same shape as Vega, but normalized differently\), what would its magnitude \(m\(4500\)\) be in the STMAG system? the ABNU system? What would the m\(4500\) - m\(5500\) color be in each of the three systems? }{}
