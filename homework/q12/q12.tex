\textbf{(2/10, 30 minutes) Say you have a system that has a
photometric zeropoint of 23.5 in the bandpass where you plan to make
observations, and you are observing at a site with 1 arcsec seeing, a
background of 21 magnitudes per square arcsec with a detector with
readout noise corresponding to 5 electrons/pixel, and a plate scale of
0.5 arcsec/pixel.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How long do you need to expose to get a S/N of 100 for a
    15th magnitude object?
    \item How long do you need to expose to get a S/N of 50 for a 22nd
    magnitude object?
\end{enumerate}}
