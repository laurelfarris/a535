\BOOKMARK [3][-]{subsubsection.0.0.1}{\(1/27, 30 mins\) Write a program that includes functions that convert between wavelength, frequency, and energy, and between F \(in ergs/cm2/s/\305\) and F \(in ergs/cm2/s/Hz\). All of these functions should exist in a single file in Python \(preferred\), IDL, C, C++, or Fortran file. Use the routines to determine frequency and energy at 5500 \305 as well as the conversion factor between F and F at 3000 \305, 5500 \305, and 8000 \305. }{}
