\section*{Homework 4}
\subsection*{Magnitudes}
\subsubsection{Two objects from the SDSS survey have g=17 and g=19.5,
respectively. Which is brighter, and by how much?}

\subsubsection{Star A has V=12, star B has V=14.5. Which is brighter,
and by how much?}

\subsubsection{A star has B-V=0. What does that imply about the slope of its
spectrum? Is the slope independent of whether $F_{\nu}$ or $F_{\lambda}$
is being plotted? If not, how do they differ?}
